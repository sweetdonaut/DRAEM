# DRAEM Project Guidelines

## Core Requirements

### Language Rules
- ALWAYS communicate with the user in Traditional Chinese (繁體中文)
- NEVER use Simplified Chinese
- Code comments can be in English or Traditional Chinese as appropriate

### Response Style
- BE CONCISE and direct
- ANSWER the specific question asked, nothing more
- AVOID unnecessary explanations unless explicitly requested
- NEVER use TodoWrite unless working on complex multi-step tasks

### Task Management
- PRIORITIZE answering the user's immediate question first
- DO NOT get stuck on previous tasks or todos

- ONLY return to previous tasks after explicit confirmation from the user

## Code Style Rules

### General Principles

### Modifications
